Years ago, Jack and Oogie Boogie were close friends. Both eager to prove themselves, they poured all their passion into their fantastical projects to earn their rightful place as the scariest duo in town. But there could only be one Pumpkin King! What could have happened to turn two best friends into such bitter rivals? \"Even if you are not familiar with the original film, the graphic novel The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Battle For Pumpkin King does justice to the original. Dan Conner's writing flows the story with the right amount of humour. Deborah Allo draws every line as if the environment and the characters are alive and we are there in the town with them. We can not miss the finesse in colouring that Roberto Scalia executes. My overall impression is that this story is beautifully illustrated; it has easy-to-follow, funny dialogues with cleverly placed subtexts on the importance of friendship and honesty.\" -- IlgÄ±n Side Soysal, The Comics Beat",

At the time, it was the only thing e felt comfortable with strangers knowing about em. Now, Gender Queer is here. Maia's intensely cathartic autobiography charts eir journey of self-identity, which includes the mortification and confusion of adolescent crushes, grappling with how to come out to family and society, bonding with friends over erotic gay fanfiction, and facing the trauma and fundamental violation of pap smears.  Started as a way to explain to eir family what it means to be nonbinary and asexual, Gender Queer is more than a personal story: it is a useful and touching guide on gender identity--what it means and how to think about it--for advocates, friends, and humans everywhere. \"It's also a great resource for those who identify as nonbinary or asexual as well as for those who know someone who identifies that way and wish to better understand.\" -- SLJ (starred review)",

From Bill Watterson, bestselling creator of the beloved comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, and John Kascht, one of America's most renowned caricaturists, comes a mysterious and beautifully illustrated fable about what lies beyond human understanding.  In a fable for grown-ups by cartoonist Bill Watterson, a long-ago kingdom is afflicted with unexplainable calamities. Hoping to end the torment, the king dispatches his knights to discover the source of the mysterious events. Years later, a single battered knight returns.  For the book's illustrations, Watterson and caricaturist John Kascht worked together for several years in unusually close collaboration. Both artists abandoned their past ways of working, inventing images together that neither could anticipate--a mysterious process in its own right.  With The Mysteries, Watterson and Kascht share the fascinating genesis of their extraordinary collaboration in a video that can be viewed on Andrews McMeel Publishing's YouTube page.",
